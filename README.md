# 8thchunin React-Practice-Projects

This repo contains a collection of practice projects that I created to learn and improve my skills in React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

# Projects

The projects in this repo are:

- Project 1: A step-by-step component that navigates through a few steps; displaying current step and content for each step.

# Installation

To run any of the projects, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

Each project is a folder containing necessary files. All you have to do is download the files from a folder.
You can make your own changes as you wish. Before downloading, make sure you have set up your vite.
Some of projects have extra dependency files so do well to check the files to know which dependencies to install.

# Usage

You can use the apps for your own learning or personal purposes. Feel free to modify the code, add new features, or fix any bugs that you find.
